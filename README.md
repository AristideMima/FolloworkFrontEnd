## About The Project

FolloworkFrontEnd is the frontend part of an application activity tracking app in order for managers 
to have a central view and a control on their employees work activity.

It therefore allows each employee of the company to be able to fill in their tasks and projects in the application.
which will be validated, monitored and controlled by his hierarchical superior.

The application presents an overview of statistics on the tasks in progress, those already carried out and those in progress.
